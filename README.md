## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS custom properties, functions and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

-   Re-learned event delegation
-   Re-learned the `.reduce` method
-   Got a better understanding of Promises
-   How to create a neat loading skeleton

### Continued development

-   I would like to continue taking on more challenging JS problems. I know this is where I will do most of my learning and want to develop this skill as much as possible.
-   I would like to work more with fetching data.

### Useful resources

-   [Favorite Resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is my favorite resource for just about anything, this helped me with touching up on `event delegation` and the `.reduce()` method.
